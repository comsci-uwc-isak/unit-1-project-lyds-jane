### Tasks done
* Fixed frame program
* Designed flow chart for frame program

### What did I learn
* How to simplify the frame program
* Confirmed how to do math in bash

### Links to syllabus
* This lesson connected to sub-units 4.1.6 and 4.2.4
* 4.1.6 is not yet avaiable on the classroom so the link to this lesson is unknown
* 4.2.4 disucusses the use of flowcharts and using them to analyze a program. By working as a class to develop a flowchart, we did a lot of problem solving and figured out how to create more complicated flowcharts, such as having a for loop within another for loop

## What has worked for me so far
I am really enjoying the computer science course so far. I like the fact that we are constantly able to change and improve our work, and that the class is more focused on skill development than assesment.

## What skills I have developed
I have developped many skills so far in computer sciences. I have gone from not knowing anything about coding or system management to understanding many concepts, such as:
* The basic process of program development
* The various stages and methods of plannning a program
* How to assess the effectiveness of a program
* Various methods of presenting and explaining a program to others

I have also learned a lot about programming, such as:
* Basic bash commands
* .sh, .txt, and .md file formats
* If statements
* While and for loops
* Arrays and ranges

## What I should change to achieve the highest performance possible
To achieve the highest performance possible, I need to organize my study notes by winter break. I want to consolodate all of the programming concepts I have learned so far, as well as go through the syllabus systematically and review the topics we have covered in class.
