### Links to syllabus
* This lesson connected to sub-units 4.1.6 and 4.2.4
* 4.1.6 is not yet avaiable on the classroom so the link to this lesson is unknown
* 4.2.4 disucusses the use of flowcharts and using them to analyze a program. By working as a class to develop a flowchart, we did a lot of problem solving and figured out how to create more complicated flowcharts, such as having a for loop within another for loop
