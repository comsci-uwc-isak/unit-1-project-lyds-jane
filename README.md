Planning
----------

The Minimal Car Rental app program is very feasible, with minimal organizational issues. The project centers around **technical feasibility**, using only bash and the terminal, making that aspect simple and not concerning. This also means that the **economic factor** of the program is very feasible, because the user does not need to spend any money on extra software or training. The project is **legal**, since all it does is record information inputted by the user. The **operational feasibility** of the project is relatively simple; each car both has its own .txt file and contributes to an aggregate .txt file, and the script prompts the user for specific inputs. The **schedule** of the project depends on the experience of the coder, however, it couldnâ€™t take more than a week to develop the programs to input various information into the files. Ultimately, this system is very realistic and could easily be developed.
